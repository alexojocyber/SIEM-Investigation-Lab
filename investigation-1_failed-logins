# Failed Login Analyzer — Script Execution & Log Review  
### Investigation 1 — SOC Log Monitoring Preparation

---

## 1. Overview

This investigation documents the creation and execution of a *Bash-based Failed Login Analyzer*, a script designed to extract and summarize failed SSH login attempts from:


/var/log/auth.log


The analyzer is built to detect:

- Total failed login attempts  
- Usernames targeted  
- Source IP addresses  
- Top 5 attacker IPs  

This tool is commonly used in SOC workflows to automate brute-force detection.

---

## 2. Script Features

### Script Name
failed_login_analyzer.sh

### Capabilities
- Counts failed login attempts  
- Extracts targeted usernames  
- Extracts attacker IP addresses  
- Lists top frequent IPs  
- Formats output for readability

### Key Commands Used
bash
grep "Failed password" $LOGFILE
awk '{print $(NF-5)}'
awk '{print $(NF-3)}'
sort | uniq -c
head -5


These mimic SIEM-like log parsing behavior using Linux tools.

## 3. Screenshots Evidence

### *Screenshot 1 — Script Code*


### *Screenshot 2 — Script Execution with sudo*
Displays:


FAILED LOGIN ANALYZER
Checking log file: /var/log/auth.log
grep: /var/log/auth.log: No such file or directory
0


This confirms:
- The script executed successfully  
- The log file currently does not exist on this Kali system  

### *Screenshot 3 — Script Header & Logic View*
Reinforces the script’s structure and intended detection flow.

---

## 4. Current Result: No Logs Found

The output shows:


/var/log/auth.log: No such file or directory


This tells us that *Kali Linux does not generate auth.log by default* on some configurations.

This is normal — depending on:
- Logging service used (rsyslog/journald)
- SSH service status
- Authentication settings  

---

## 5. Why This Happens

Most modern Kali installations use:


/var/log/journal/


instead of /var/log/auth.log.

Additionally, SSH may be disabled by default, meaning:

- No SSH login attempts  
- No authentication failures  
- No brute-force logs yet  

---

## 6. Next Steps (To Generate Real Logs)

To produce real failed login data:

### Step 1 — Enable SSH server
bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh


### Step 2 — Attempt failed logins manually  
Open another terminal or use a second machine:

bash
ssh wronguser@127.0.0.1
ssh root@127.0.0.1
ssh admin@127.0.0.1


Enter wrong passwords 5–10 times.

### Step 3 — Check logs
On some systems:

bash
sudo journalctl -u ssh


Or enable rsyslog to generate /var/log/auth.log:

bash
sudo systemctl enable rsyslog
sudo systemctl start rsyslog

## 7. Cybersecurity Relevance

This investigation demonstrates:

- Building custom log-analysis tools  
- Using Linux commands for SOC-style parsing  
- Understanding how authentication logs are stored  
- Preparing a machine for brute-force detection  

Once logs are generated, the script can detect and classify brute-force attempts.

---

## 8. Summary

This phase of the investigation confirms:

- The log analyzer script works  
- It runs without error  
- The system currently has no failed login entries  
- Further configuration is needed to capture real attack data  

Follow-up investigations will include:

- Actual brute-force attempts  
- IOC extraction  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Detection + remediation recommendations
